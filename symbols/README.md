The mathematical structures used in Sacred Geometry can be found in the arts, architecture and even in our DNA. These structures are everywhere, and serve as a link between analytical thinking and the intuitive side, or between science and spirituality.
This work shows Sacred Geometry symbols modeled in 2D and 3D, with views that can be accessed with Augmented Reality resources and also in immersive Virtual Reality rooms.

<a href="vr/FlowerOfLife.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/7A.png" class="foto" alt="Flower of Life"></a><img src="ar/7.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The Flower of Life symbol is constructed of 19 interlocking circles, surrounded by a larger circle. It is a well-known representation that appears in the pyramids of Egypt and in buildings in Greece, China, England, Tibet and Israel. The Flower of Life is believed to represent the cosmic blueprint, which encodes the design of each atomic structure.

<a href="vr/TreeOfLife.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/11A.png" class="foto" alt="Tree of Life"></a><img src="ar/11.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The Tree of Life symbol represents a connection with everything, including the things we cannot see, reminding us that we are not alone in the universe. The 10 spheres of this symbol are called "Sephiroth", they mean emanation and are connected by different paths. The bottom Sephira represents the material world and the top Sephira represents cosmic consciousness. The other Sephiras represent the qualities of the soul and are divided into three pillars: severity, gentleness and mercy.
 <br><br>
 <a href="ra.html" class="raAR" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank"></a>

<h4>14. Fruit of Life</h4>
<a href="vr/FruitOfLife.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/12A.png" class="foto" alt="Fruit of Life"></a><img src="ar/12.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The symbol of the Fruit of Life is formed by 13 interconnected spheres and can be considered one of the most powerful in Sacred Geometry. It appears hidden within the Flower of Life symbol and can be used to create the 78 lines of the Metatron's Cube symbol.
 <br><br>
  <a href="ra.html" class="raAR" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank"></a>
 <hr>
<h4>15. Fruit of Life 3D</h4>

 <h4>16. Golden spiral</h4>
<a href="vr/GoldenSpiral.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/27A.png" class="foto" alt="Golden Spiral"></a><img src="ar/27.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>We define that the numbers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are in the golden ratio when <b>(a + b) / a = a / b = &Phi;</b>. Putting this ratio in two dimensions, we can construct golden rectangles (or triangles), where their sides are in the golden ratio. This proportion is not just a mathematical notion, but also a symbol of beauty, harmony and perfection in art, science and nature. This term was introduced by Leonardo da Vinci as a proportion of "ideal perfect body" and appears in the petals of various flowers, sunflower seed arrangements, pine cone patterns and romanesco broccoli.

 <br><br><br>Metatron is a seraphim archangel of medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian tradition. Artistic depictions almost always depict Archangel Metatron holding or near a mysterious cube. The construction of Metatron's Cube involves 13 circles housed within a larger circle. The lines that join the centers of these circles define the Metaton Cube.
 <br><br>
  <a href="ra1.html" class="raAR" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank"></a>

<h4>19. Grid of life</h4>
<a href="vr/GridOfLife.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/16A.png" class="foto" alt="Grid of life"></a><img src="ar/16.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The symbol of the Grid of Life, also called tetrahedron 64, contrasts the Star Tetrahedron with the Flower of Life. We have 64 tetrahedra that form the Grid of Life symbol, which can be overlayed on the Flower of Life symbol, with the circles symbolizing the vastness of space and the interconnected lines indicating where space converges over time.
 <br><br>
  <a href="ra1.html" class="raAR" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank"></a>
 <hr>
<h4>20. Grid of life 3D</h4>
<a href="vr/GridOfLife3d.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/17A.png" class="foto" alt="Grid of life 3D"></a><img src="ar/17.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>Much of the fascination of the Grid of Life symbol comes from the number 64, which appears recurrently in nature, constructions and mysticism. Some examples that we can cite are: in computing, where the number of 64 bits of memory is essential; in the classic games of chess or checkers, which have 64 squares on their boards; or in sacred texts of Hinduism, which references 64 tantras. In this example, we have the Grid of life modeled in 3D.

<a href="vr/Torus.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/18A.png" class="foto" alt="Torus"></a><img src="ar/18.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The structure of a torus, similar to a vortex, is considered to be the initial form emanating from the Genesis pattern. The representation of the torus in Sacred Geometry reflects the spiral flow of energy. This flow is not unidirectional, oscillating on the torus surface and spiraling within its core.
 <br><br>
 <a href="ra1.html" class="raAR" title="Augmented reality" target="_blank"></a>

<a href="vr/Merkaba.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/19A.png" class="foto" alt="Merkaba star"></a><img src="ar/19.png" class="qr">
 <br><br><br>The Merkaba star symbol or Star Tetrahedron or Star of Davi has the meaning translated as "light, spirit and body". It is the fusion of 2 identical tetrahedra that are interconnected through rotations in opposite directions. The intersection of these tetrahedra creates an energy field that radiates immense power. In this example, we have the Merkaba star modeled in 3D.

<h4>29. Sri Yantra</h4>
<a href="vr/SriYantra.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/29A.png" class="foto" alt="Sri Yantra"></a>
 <br><br><br>The Sri Yantra is a geometric draw that represents the union of the masculine and feminine energies of the universe. It is one of the most complex and powerful forms of Sacred Geometry. This symbol has nine interlocking triangles that surround a central point and guide the mind to higher states of consciousness. Focusing on the central point, called the "bindu", helps to access a deep connection with universal energy. The "bindu" symbolizes the origin of the universe, the point from which all creation emanates, and around which reality is organized. The word "Sri" means wealth and prosperity, and "Yantra" means instrument.
 <br><br><br>

<h4>30. Sri Yantra 3D</h4>
<a href="vr/SriYantrav1.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/30A.png" class="foto" alt="Sri Yantra 3D"></a>
 <br><br><br>The Sri Yantra consists of four triangles pointing upwards (masculine energy, Shiva) and five pointing downwards (feminine energy, Shakti). The intersections between the triangles form 43 smaller triangles, which mirror the cosmos. Each smaller triangle is related to an intelligence or archetype. The Sri Yantra is one of the most complex and powerful forms of Sacred Geometry. The word "Sri" means wealth and prosperity, and "Yantra" means instrument.

<h4>31. Triquetra</h4>
<a href="vr/Triquetra.htm" target="_blank" title="3D model" class="fotoA"><img src="ar/31A.png" class="foto" alt="Triquetra"></a>
 <br><br><br>The triquetra is a geometric symbol that represents eternity, trinity and unity. It is made up of three intertwined arches, with no beginning or end. The word triquetra comes from the Latin triquætra (three points). The symbol is similar to a triskelion (a Celtic symbol that represents the three worlds: the celestial, physical and spiritual). The triquetra is present in many cultures and traditions.
 <br><br><br>

 <br><br><br><br>The golden ratio is believed to represent a divine proportion and a harmonious relationship between different parts of a whole. The pentagram and the hexagram have been used in various religious and spiritual practices, representing harmony, balance, and the union of opposites. In Sacred Geometry, the pentagram (five-pointed star) represents the union of the five elements: air, fire, water, earth and spirit. This symbol is also linked to the golden ratio and is considered a symbol of balance, harmony and spiritual mastery.
